# Mac-like Keyboard Shortcuts on Windows 10
Personal AutoHotkey script (.ahk) to simulate MacOS-like keyboard shortcuts on Windows 10 (e.g. map LAlt+C to CTRL+C to simulate CMD+C).

This also includes some experimentation with remaps when specific games are running and focused (e.g. using Caps Lock as LAlt).
